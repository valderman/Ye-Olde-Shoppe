Ye Olde Shoppe, v0.1
--
A lightweight Bukkit plugin for creating sign shops and paid teleports.


** Building

Import the entire src directory into Eclipse, get the latest Bukkit snapshot,
 add it to the project as a dependency (link and instructions for doing
that can be found at
http://wiki.bukkit.org/Plugin_Tutorial#Reference_the_Bukkit_API) and export
the entire thing as a jar file. Place in Bukkit plugin directory and reload.


** Playing

To place a shop, first attach a sign to a wall and format its text as follows:
-- (start of sign) --
<name of resource you're buying/selling>
Buy <amount> for <cost>g
Sell <amount> for <cost>g
<this line intentionally left blank>
-- (end of sign) --

You can leave out either the Buy or the Sell line, but not both. If you've
done it right, your name will appear in brackets on the sign's bottom line.
Now, place a chest under the sign and fill it with the amount of goods you
want to put up for sale and/or the amount of gold you want to buy other
people's resources for.

For example, if I wanted to sell diamonds for 10 gold ingots apiece and buy
them for 5, I'd put this on my sign:
-- (start of sign) --
Diamond
Buy 1 for 10g
Sell 1 for 5g

-- (end of sign) --
...and then I'd place a chest underneath and fill it with gold ingots and
diamonds.

You can also place paid teleports. To do this, you need to set a waypoint.
To set a waypoint, walk where you want the waypoint to be, then say
"/ywarp add <name>" where <name> is whatever you want to call your waypoint.
At the moment, only ops can add waypoints.

You then place your teleport just like you would a shop, but format your sign
like so:
-- (start of sign) --
<waypoint name>

Fare: <cost>g

-- (end of sign) --
You may use both the first and second line for the waypoint name if it's long;
the newline between them will be treated as a space, so if you put:
My
House
It will be interpreted as the waypoint "My House".

To travel or buy resources, simply right click on a shop sign with a gold
ingot in hand. The correct amount of gold will be transferred from your
inventory to the chest under the sign. To sell resources, right click a
shop sign while holding the resource you want to sell.

Shops can't be looted or destroyed by anyone but its owner or an op.


** Known bugs

- Shops can be destroyed by pistons.
- Waypoints aren't owned, so anyone with the privileges to add new waypoints
  can overwrite yours.
